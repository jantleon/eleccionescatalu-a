In this project I analyse catalonian parties' manifestos for 2021 regional election. I use tf-idf, a statistic that shows the importance of a word in a single document compared to a set of documents. This statistic helps us to know what are the main words (or topics) expressed by each political party on its manifesto in comparison to other parties ones.
